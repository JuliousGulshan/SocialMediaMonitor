I cancelled my Verizon account two days before the contract ended in person.  The rep post-dated it to the contract end date.  Last Friday, Verizon billed me $14.10 and charged my credit card.  I can access past billing statements online but there is no mention of this, and I have yet to receive anything in the mail.  I'm tempted to dispute the charge.
