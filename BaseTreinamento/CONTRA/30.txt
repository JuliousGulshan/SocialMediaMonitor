California and Florida Verizon Customers.  Latest \"new\" hidden surcharge.  Since July we are now being charged $2.90 on average per bill, for _REGIONAL SPORTS NETWORK FEE._  Whether you watch any sports at all we are being charged to be able to watch The RAYS, or high school football, whatever.  Check your bill.  This is under VERIZON surcharges and other charges.  Federal Universal service fee, Regulatory recovery fee, and Regional Sports network fee.  For average customers, this is another $72.00 per year in taxes.  This is just another ridiculous charge to drive up their profits.  Aghhhh
