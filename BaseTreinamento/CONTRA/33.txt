Listen up all Verizon customers! My son goes into the Verizon store with IPhone that has a broken power button. This is before 1 yr warranty expires. They replace phone. All is good. Then I get a bill for $299. They claim WATER damage. They send phones to a warehouse and this is what they claim. This is after the fact.  They're crooks. I would have upgraded phone if this info was given to him in the store. There was no water damage. Just another way to swindle money from us when locked into a contract!!!  Beware everyone. Pack of crooks.
