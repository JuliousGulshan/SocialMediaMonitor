Holy crap has anyone heard about Verizon getting a chance to buy out all of our small wireless companies at a huge discount on our dollars? I say we as Canadians put a stop to this and the best way to do it is not buying in to it. If your planning on switching providers in the near future because of cheaper prices make sure to look into them first. Make sure they're Canadian first. If we as a people let this happen we can be sure all of our providers are going to get crushed in the end. Costing us god only knows how much in infrastructure and jobs!\nWe need to put Verizon out of business in Canada if we want to save our employment rate and economy. Set a standard for foreign companies trying to buy into Canada. If capitalism is going to work for all then there can't be any discounts.
