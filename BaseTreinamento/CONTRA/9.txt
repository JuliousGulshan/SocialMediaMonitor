Hey everybody I have 2 lines with verizon that's not being used anymore.  I'm trying to avoid a cancellation fee on both lines.  the only way of doing that is by transferring the lines to somebody else ie new customer  or adding a extra lines to your account....So if you looking to switch to verizon or wanna add a line hit me up and let me know so I can get these phones off my bill.....
