Looks like Bell, Telus and Rogers stopped scrapping with each other long enough to join forces against Verizon..The Ad they put out is pretty hilarious. That it's going to cost Canadians more. They are just protecting their own interests nothing more. I can show you a way to pay yourself on these bills plus energy bills and much more
