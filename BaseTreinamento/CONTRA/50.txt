Okay. . . I am beyond frustrated right now! I cannot do anything from my phone that involves the use of the keypad. . .which is 99.8\u0025 of everything!!!! Cant text, dial a phone number, send an email, respond to comments or post on this page or my own account!!! \nI have been trying to delete things from my phone thinking it was because the storage is full, not helping! I will have to try to go into Verizon tomorrow or Monday \nIm not ignoring anyone . . Here. . .or text messages and emails. . . I can see them I just cant respond! \nI am posting this from my old Galexy tablet. . .empasis on the word OLD. . .I nev use this thing cuz it wont hold a charge and also it just randomly powers off nwhenever it wants too! That is why I am not even attempting to go thru my notifications on it because I know I will become even more infuriated! \nI still had a photo of the beautiful Tater-Tot to enter in the auction and another jewelry case and a blue camo leash and harness set like the pink set already in there but cannot get it done now. I give up! It seems like if its not one thing. . .its another ugh.....\nI will still be closing the auction at 10:00 p.m. Eastern time tomorrow night. If you are able to share it for me that would help out a great deal and I would really appreciate it, seeing as how Ive been charging this pos for hours just to post this and its already beeping letting me know I am at 10\u0025 battery left! \nWe prob wont be back on tonight so Ellouise and I love you all very much and hope you are having a fabulous weekend. We will be back tomorrow \nXoXoX ~the mommy
